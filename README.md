Technical Considerations
Database Management: MySQL will be used to manage user accounts, appointments, doctors, and check-in records.
Frontend Development: A basic website will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.
Backend Development: A server-side language (e.g., PHP, Python) will handle database interactions and business logic.
Security: Implement secure password storage (e.g., hashing) and data validation to protect user information.
Conclusion
This NHS Appointment Booking System aims to streamline the appointment process for patients while providing a user-friendly interface and robust backend management. By following the outlined components and workflow, the system can enhance patient experience and improve operational efficiency within the NHS framework.
